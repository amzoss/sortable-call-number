# sortable-call-number-vba
An Excel add-in for converting a Library of Congress call number into something sortable.

This add-in can be added to Excel in the [normal fashion](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-add-ins-in-excel-0af570c4-5cf3-4fa9-9b88-403625a0b460#OfficeVersion=Windows). Once added, you should be able to use a custom function called `=SORTABLE_CALL_NO()` in any file. (Inside the parentheses for the function, add a reference to a cell that contains a valid Library of Congress call number.)
